additional features
- press shift while shuffling or rotating to go the other way
- the window is not bound to a certain size only aspect ratio, if you change window height in main.cpp it will become that size and work fine
- in theory the boards row and column numbers should be changeable too
- tiles ease in from off the top of the screen
- i didnt use a single line of the skeleton code
- blocks appear in random parts of the top row not always the same point (they also spawn randomly rotated)

wish list of uncomplete features
- figure out what the heck i was supposed to do with the floating blocks out of line with a line of like fruits... the description says nothing
- implement animated deletions of blocks (i almost had enough time)
- to hook all my tiles into a single shader and vao so i never have to bind a new one during render
any point
- multithread checks for deletion (rows and fruits)... once again i almost had enough time
- comment more of my code

additional instructions
- if it fails to build please email me... i did compile it on the school computers and test but i am a little weary...
